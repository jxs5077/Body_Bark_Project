## Project Requirements and Overview 
The requirements of this team project was to create a custom D3.js visualaztion utilizing a database with more than 100 records. Internet sales data was taken from Body Bark’s website in which we removed private customer information.  Then, a data schema was developed for maximum data efficiency storage.

Data Focus- Knowing how products are selling through is an important aspect of sourcing and inventory planning. A small company needs to know not only what styles are selling through but what colors sell best due to minimum buy lots.

## Visualizations

We were able to create five unique visualizations, each of which anazlyzed Body Bark's customer sales by color, and a heatmap depicting the location of boutiques who purchase wholesale, as seen below:
